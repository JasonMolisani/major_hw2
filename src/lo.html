                    <p>
                        The internet started in 1969 with a group of programmers lead by Leonard Kleinrock. They were
                        commissioned by ARPA, part of the US government, to enable computers in different locations to
                        talk to each other.

                        The biggest problem was that large messages took too long to send and blocked the pipe. To
                        solve this, the team came up with the idea of packet switching. All messages would be broken up
                        into small packets that could be sent without blocking the pipe for too long. The packets would
                        then be reassembled on the other side. Disassembling and reassembling these messages into and
                        from packets was done with a machine called the Internet Message Processor
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first message was sent from Standford to UCLA. It was a remote login attempt that was
                        tracked on both ends through researchers connected through a separate phone call. To log in,
                        the letters L-O-G would need to be sent. Lo and behold, only the first two letters were sent
                        before the system crashed. Thus we have the first message sent from the internet: "LO."
