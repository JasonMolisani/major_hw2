                    <h3 id="surveillance">Internet Surveillance</h3>

                    <p>
                        Most people can think of the internet as a mail system. They expect what they send in a "sealed
                        envelope" to only be read by the intended recipient. With physical mail, the recipient would
                        probably be able to at least notice if someone else opened the envelope before them. The
                        internet is a digital existence. There is no way to detect if someone else has made their own
                        copy of what you sent. A couple of the most egregious cases of government surveillance happened
                        in the United States and China. In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that that the NSA had been
                        listening to of the communications of average American citizens. China has their Golden Shield
                        project where they are actively trying to create a database of information on each of their
                        citizens.

                    <h3 id="censor">Government Censorship</h3>

                    <p>
                        The next step past listening to everyone's communications is controlling what they can hear.
                        The Great Firewall of China serves to prevent their citizens from viewing anything that goes
                        against the government. France and Germany have bans regarding Nazi propaganda.

                    <h3 id="mod">Need for Moderation</h3>

                    <p>
                        Surveillance aside, the internet usually provides a large degree of anonymity. This anonymity
                        can lead to a lack of accountability. Also, not having to witness the face of a person you hurt
                        can lead to a desensitization. Words on a screen don't convey emotion. Companies with large
                        public websites are compelled to employ moderators to police their own sites and remove
                        offensive content. This is a thankless job with an very high burn-out rate. The average
                        moderator quits in 3-6 months.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="cyber">Cyber Bullying</h3>

                    <p>
                        As was stated earlier, anonymity provides a lack of accountability. Some people use this to
                        oppress others. The internet is a content neutral technology. It does not care what it is
                        sending. It just delivers the packages where it is told. This leaves the internet a lot like
                        the wild west. There is no law enforcement. The biggest problem with law enforcement is that it
                        is impossible to implement without surveillance.

                    <h3 id="swat">Swatting</h3>

                    <p>
                        One of the most dramatic forms of cyber bullying, swatting involves finding someone's home
                        address and calling 9-1-1 to report a fake emergency as a "prank." Having the a SWAT team show
                        up and break into your house to arrest you when you have done nothing wrong would feel awful.
