                    <h3 id="aol">America Online</h3>

                    <p>
                        Before the 1990s, computers were very expensive and internet speed was very slow. When
                        television brought up the idea of cable, enterprising companies saw the possibility of using
                        this new TV-wire instead of phone line for faster internet. The 90s also saw the introduction
                        of the more affordable personal computer. Even with these problems solved, connecting to the
                        internet was still very complicated.

                    <p>
                        America Online brought the internet to millions of Americans. They did this by literally giving
                        away the software necessary to connect to internet. Instead of a complicated process, customers
                        just needed to insert the free CD and click install. Now that people could easily obtain access
                        to the internet, a whole new line of communication was available.

                    <h3 id="im">Instant Messaging</h3>

                    <p>
                        One of the most obvious new channels of communication was email. Who doesn't remember the iconic
                        "you've got mail" of AOL. Other than email, internet providers quickly noticed the rule of two
                        thirds. This rule said that two thirds of the internet traffic they witnessed would be users
                        accessing the message boards or using instant messaging. This led companies to program their
                        own instant messaging clients. AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) is one example.

                    <h3 id="facebook">Facebook</h3>

                    <p>
                        Email and instant messaging are both methods of sending a message to a specific person. The
                        current internet does more than just that. The current internet allows people to broadcast and
                        share their life. Facebook, one of the most prolific ways to do this, was launched in 2004 my
                        Mark Zuckerberg. Aside from Facebook, there is also instagram, twitter, youtube, and many other
                        clients that perform similar functions.
