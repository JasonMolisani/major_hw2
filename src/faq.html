          <h3>What is the Internet?</h3>

          <p>
            Computers talk to each other through a network. The local router your internet service provider lent you
            creates a private network that your computers can use to talk to each other. In order to send a message to
            a friend's computer at their house,  you need to connect your priavte network to theirs. This network of
            INTER-connected NET-works is the internet.
          </p>

          <h3>How are they connected?</h3>

          <p>
            Most of the finer points will be handled by your internet service provider. They will manage the network of
            all the customers they have in a region. If a customer wants to talk to someone who is in a different region
            or has a different internet service provider their message will need to be routed through an exchange point.
          </p>

          <h3>What is an internet exchange point?</h3>

          <p>
            An internet exchange point is a massive room filled with countless routers and switches that are
            transferring data from one network to another over physical cables. This is the closest you can come to
            physically interacting with the internet.
          </p>

          <h3>What is the cloud?</h3>

          <p>
            When your file is saved "in the cloud" it is really saved in a physical server room somewhere. This
            server room will look a lot an internet exchange point. Instead of rounters and switches, the server room
            will be filled with computers.
