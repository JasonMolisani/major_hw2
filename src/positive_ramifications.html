                    <p>
                        The internet opened new avenues for communication between people. Email is just one of the many
                        new ways people can communicate. Instant messaging and video calls are just a few of the more
                        basic options.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="knowledge">Wikipedia, Google, and More</h3>

                    <p>
                        The internet has led to more widespread access to knowledge. Wikipedia serves as a great way to
                        get a basic understanding of a wide range of topics. If Wikipedia doesn't have the answer,
                        Google is a search engine that can help find an answer. There are many other sources of
                        information. Programmers can refer to Stack Overflow. People interesting in doing things
                        themselves can look up tutorial videos on Youtube.

                    <h3 id="twitch">Content Creators</h3>

                    <p>
                        The presence of Youtube and the later emergence of Twitch led to the creation of a new type of
                        job: content creator. It is now possible for a person to make a living from home by just making
                        Youtube videos. There are other people who can make a living streaming themselves playing video
                        games from their own room.

                    <h3 id="charity">Ice Bucket Challenge</h3>

                    <p>
                        The internet also provides a great way to gather a large number of people for a cause. In 2014,
                        the Ice Bucket Challenge was a viral campaign that raised over $115 dollars in 6 weeks to help
                        find a cure for ALS. The premise was simple. Record a video of you having a bucket of cold
                        water poured over your head. Make a donation. Challenge someone else.
