                             <h3 id="surveillance">Internet Surveillance</h3>
                            <p>Most people can think of the internet as a mail system. They expect what
                                they send in a "sealed envelope" to only be read by the intended recipient.
                                With physical mail, the recipient would probably be able to at least notice
                                if someone else opened the envelope before them. The internet is a digital
                                existence. There is no way to detect if someone else has made their own
                                copy of what you sent. A couple of the most egregious cases of government
                                surveillance happened in the United States and China. In 2013, Edward Snowden
                                revealed that that the NSA had been listening to of the communications
                                of average American citizens. China has their Golden Shield project where
                                they are actively trying to create a database of information on each of
                                their citizens.</p>
                             <h3 id="censor">Government Censorship</h3>
                            <p>The next step past listening to everyone's communications is controlling
                                what they can hear. The Great Firewall of China serves to prevent their
                                citizens from viewing anything that goes against the government. France
                                and Germany have bans regarding Nazi propaganda.</p>
                             <h3 id="mod">Need for Moderation</h3>
                            <p>Surveillance aside, the internet usually provides a large degree of anonymity.
                                This anonymity can lead to a lack of accountability. Also, not having to
                                witness the face of a person you hurt can lead to a desensitization. Words
                                on a screen don't convey emotion. Companies with large public websites
                                are compelled to employ moderators to police their own sites and remove
                                offensive content. This is a thankless job with an very high burn-out rate.
                                The average moderator quits in 3-6 months.</p>
                             <h3 id="cyber">Cyber Bullying</h3>
                            <p>As was stated earlier, anonymity provides a lack of accountability. Some
                                people use this to oppress others. The internet is a content neutral technology.
                                It does not care what it is sending. It just delivers the packages where
                                it is told. This leaves the internet a lot like the wild west. There is
                                no law enforcement. The biggest problem with law enforcement is that it
                                is impossible to implement without surveillance.</p>
                             <h3 id="swat">Swatting</h3>
                            <p>One of the most dramatic forms of cyber bullying, swatting involves finding
                                someone's home address and calling 9-1-1 to report a fake emergency as
                                a "prank." Having the a SWAT team show up and break into your house to
                                arrest you when you have done nothing wrong would feel awful.</p>
